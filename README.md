# mediumNoMorePremium
This script is dedicated to those distracted people like me who don't want to lose the 5 premium articles due to missclicks so to avoid that, the premium elements are blurry to make them stand out

Copy this script, open medium (duh) from **Chrome/Firefox : press <em>ctrl+shift+i</em> or Menu>More Tools>Development Tools** and paste it into the console.
Ps: remember that you have to do this manually everytime you close the browser, until i have the time to make the extension lol
